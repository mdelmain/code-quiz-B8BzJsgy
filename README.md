# 04 Code Quiz

## Description 
For the module 4 assignment I built a code quiz in JavaScript. When the quiz starts, a 75 second timer is displayed on the navigation bar and one question is displayed at a time. If the wrong answer is selected, ten seconds are subtracted from the timer. At the end of the game, the seconds left is displayed as the score and the user can input their initials. Users can also track high scores on a separate page.

The webpage can be found here: https://mdelmain.github.io/code-quiz-B8BzJsgy
